Java Collections 

Collection Framework and Data Structures

- List (ArrayList + LinkedList)
- Set (HashSet + LinkedHashSet + TreeSet)
- Map (HashMap + LinkedHashMap + TreeMap)
- Queue + Stack

Note: 
1. Collection -> Interface in Java
2. Collections -> Utility Class


Why do we use collections when we have Arrays ?
- Arrays are static in length
- It is very difficult to add or remove items from the array
- Not many inbuilt function
- Collections have many inbuilt functions


As a QA automation engineer what do you need to learn in collections

-- You need to know what are the different collections available
-- how to create each collection in Java
-- how to add or remove items from collections
-- how to iterate through items without removing the items in the collections
-- when to use right collection


List:
-- List is a ordered collection
-- list can contain duplicate elements
-- list can accept NULL also
-- maintains insertion order
-- elements can be inserted or accesses by their position in the list
   --- ArrayList
   --- LinkedList
   --- Vector (outdated - not used)
   
 Set :  set can not have duplicate items
   HashSet : does not maintain order
   LinkedHashSet : maintains insertion order
   TreeSet:  Ascending order
   
  map : is interface provides key +  value pair
  
  Queues are collections with FIFO
  Stack are collections with LIFO
