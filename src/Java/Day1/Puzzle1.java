 * A man is allocated a task.  He doubles the task done everyday.  
 * If the man completely does the task in 18 days, how many days did it take for the man to complete 25% of task.
 * 
 * 100% of task = 18 days

	As he doubles the task everyday. So,

	50% of task = 17 days

	25% of task = 16 days.
