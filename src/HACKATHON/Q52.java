/*
 * Q52. What is the difference between Error and exception?
 * 
 * Exception is an abnormal condition in the code, which disrupts the normal flow of the program.
 * Exception handling is to maintain the normal flow of the application (exception can be handled).
 * 
 * Error is irrecoverable e.g. OutOfMemoryError, VirtualMachineError, AssertionError, StackoverflowError etc
