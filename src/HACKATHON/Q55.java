/*
 * Q55. What is the difference between final and finally? 
 * 
 * Answer:
 * 
 * 1)	Final is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variable. 
 		Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed.	
 		
 		Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not. 
 		
2)		Final is a keyword.		
		Finally is a block.
