/*
 * Q57. What are the different types of interface? (Ans List, set, Queue) 
 * 
 * answer:
 * 
 * List interface :
 * 
 * It can have duplicate values.
 * List interface is implemented by the classes ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, and Stack.
 * 
 * ArrayList:
 * It uses a dynamic array to store the duplicate element of different data types. 
 * The ArrayList class maintains the insertion order. 
 * The elements stored in the ArrayList class can be randomly accessed.
 * 
 * LinkedList:
 * It uses a doubly linked list internally to store the elements. It can store the duplicate elements. 
 * It maintains the insertion order. In LinkedList, the manipulation is fast because no shifting is required.
 * 
 * Vector : is out-dated
 * 
 * Set Interface:
 * It represents the unordered set of elements which doesn't allow us to store the duplicate items. We can store at most one null value in Set. 
 * Set is implemented by HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.
 * 
 *  HashSet : does not maintain order
 *  LinkedHashSet : maintains insertion order
 *  TreeSet:  Ascending order
 *  
 *  Queue Interface
 *  Queue interface maintains the first-in-first-out order. 
 *  It can be defined as an ordered list that is used to hold the elements which are about to be processed. 
 *  There are various classes like PriorityQueue, Dequeue, and ArrayDeque which implements the Queue interface.
