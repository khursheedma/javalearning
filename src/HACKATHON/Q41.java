 * Q41. What is the difference between String and String buffer? 
 * 
 * answer:
 * 
 * 1)	String class is immutable.	
 * 		StringBuffer class is mutable.
 * 2)	String is slow and consumes more memory when you concat too many strings because every time it creates new instance.	
 * 		StringBuffer is fast and consumes less memory when you concat strings.
