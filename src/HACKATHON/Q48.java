 * Q48. Why Java is Platform independent?

Answer:

Java code can be run on multiple platforms, for example, Windows, Linux, Sun Solaris, Mac/OS, etc. 
Java code is compiled by the compiler and converted into bytecode. 
This bytecode is a platform-independent code because it can be run on multiple platforms, i.e., Write Once and Run Anywhere(WORA) language.
