/*
 * Q39. What is method overloading and Method over riding?
 
 Answer:
 
 	1. Method Overloading: 
	 	If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters/arguments/data types is known as method overloading.
	  	--- there are two ways to overload method in Java :
	  		1. by having the different number of parameters/arguments
	   		2. by having the different data types
	   
	2. Method Overriding:
	   If a subclass has the same method as declared in the base class, it is known as method overriding in Java
	   
	   	Usage of Java Method Overriding

   			Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is already provided by its base class.
    		Method overriding is used for runtime polymorphism
    	
    	Rules for Java Method Overriding

    		The method must have the same name as in the parent class
    		The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class.
    		There must be an IS-A relationship (inheritance).
