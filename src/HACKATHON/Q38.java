/*
 * Q38. What is Polymorphism and encapsulation?
 *
 *   What is polymorphism?
 *   The word "Poly" means many and "morphs" means forms.
 *   There are two types of polymorphism in Java
 *   	1. Compile-time polymorphism  ex: method overloading
 *   	2. Run-time polymorphism ex:  method overriding
 *   
 *   1. Method Overloading: 
 *   If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters/arguments/data types is known as method overloading.
 *   --- there are two ways to overload method in Java :
 *   		1. by having the different number of parameters/arguments
 *   		2. by having the different data types
 *   
 *   2. Method Overriding:
 *   If a subclass has the same method as declared in the base class, it is known as method overriding in Java
 *   
 *   Encapsulation:
 *   	Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit
 *   
 *   	We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private. 
 *   	Now we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.
 *   
 *   	Encapsulation -> HAS A relation
