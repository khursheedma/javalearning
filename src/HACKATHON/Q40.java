/*
 * Q40. Why string is Immutable?
 * 
 * Answer : 
 * 	Once string object is created it's data or state can't be changed but a new string object is created
 * 
 * 	Because java uses the concept of string literal.
 * 	Suppose there are 5 reference variables,all refers to one object "Hello".If one reference variable changes the value of the object, it will be affected to all the reference variables. 
 * 	That is why string objects are immutable in java
 *  
 *  There can not be more than one string with same value in memory
 *  String can not change value, instead a new string is formed always, when edited
 *  For security reason (strings are used for password etc)
 *
