/*
 * Q56. Will java supports multiple inheritance? 
 * 
 * Answer : No.  Interface helps to overcome this problem in Java.
 * 
 * To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, multiple inheritance is not supported in java.
 * Consider a scenario where A, B, and C are three classes. The C class inherits A and B classes. 
 * If A and B classes have the same method and you call it from child class object, there will be ambiguity to call the method of A or B class.
 * Since compile-time errors are better than runtime errors, Java renders compile-time error if you inherit 2 classes. 
 * So whether you have same method or different, there will be compile time error.
