 * Q45. What is set in java?
 
Answer: 

It represents the unordered set of elements which doesn't allow us to store the duplicate items. 
We can store at most one null value in Set. Set is implemented by HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.

HashSet : does not maintain order
LinkedHashSet : maintains insertion order
TreeSet:  Ascending order

Set can be instantiated as:

    Set<data-type> s1 = new HashSet<data-type>();  
    Set<data-type> s2 = new LinkedHashSet<data-type>();  
    Set<data-type> s3 = new TreeSet<data-type>();
