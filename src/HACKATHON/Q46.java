/*
 * Q46. What is an abstract class?
 * 
 * Answer :
 * 
 * A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in Java. 
 * It can have abstract (method with no definition/body) and non-abstract methods (method with definition/body).
 * It needs to be extended and it's method implemented.
 * 
 * 
    An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
    It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
    It cannot be instantiated.  It's child class can be instantiated
    It can have constructors and static methods also.
    It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.
