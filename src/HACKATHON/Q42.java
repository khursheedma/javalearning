 Q42. What is the difference between array and array list? 
  
  Answer:		
  		Java array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type. 
  		-	The elements of an array are stored in a contiguous memory location. 
  		-	Static/fixed in length.
  		-	Not many built in methods are available
  		-	Very difficult to add or remove items from the array
  		
 		Java ArrayList class uses a dynamic array for storing the elements
    	- Maintains insertion order.
    	- Dynamic in length
    	- Many built in methods are available
    	- Easy to add or remove items from the array
